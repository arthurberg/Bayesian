:::{.example #taxicabs name="Taxicabs" .lizi}
A simple implementation of the taxicab problem with a single sample is presented using JAGS.

For each parameter, n.eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor (at convergence, Rhat=1).

:::{.exercise #taxi-counter name="Taxi counter" .prob}
Suppose taxis were sampled with the following code

```r
myrange=sort(rnbinom(2,5,mu=rgamma(2,shape=50,rate=1/200)))
taxis=sample(myrange[1]:myrange[2],10,replace=TRUE)
```
Knowing the data generating mechanism, construct a Bayesian estimate of the total number of taxis (`diff(myrange)+1`) based on the data provided by `taxis`. You can use JAGS or R as you like.
