# Class 1

## Probability Fundamentals


:::{.example #binomial-flips name="binomial flips" .lizi}
Consider 100 flips of a fair coin.

(a) What is the probability of observing exactly 50 heads in 100 flips of a fair coin?

(b) What is the probability of observing 50 or more heads?

(c) How many heads would be extreme in the sense that there is less than a 5% chance of observing that many heads or more?

:::{.exercise #marbles name="marbles" .prob}
Suppose thereâ€™s a bag containing 50 marbles with each marble being either red or yellow. 

(a) Five marbles are randomly selected **with replacement** and each one is found to be yellow. What is the probability all of the marbles in the bag are yellow?

(b) Five marbles are randomly selected **without replacement** and all are found to be yellow. What is the probability all of the marbles in the bag are yellow?

## Monte Carlo

:::{.example #gemstones name="gemstones" .lizi}
Suppose there are $n$ bags labeled $1,\ldots,n$ with bag $i$ containing $i$ rubies and $n-i$ diamonds. Suppose a bag $i$ is selected with probability directly proportional with $i$, and a random gemstone is selected from that bag. What is the probability that it is a diamond? Provide a theoretical calculation and a simulated approximation.

:::{.exercise #icer name="ICER" .prob}
Suppose a patient with heart failure has a survival time that is exponential with mean $\theta_N$ years. Suppose a heart transplant has a $\theta_T$ operative survival rate, and, if they survive, their survival, $s_P$, follows an exponential distribution with mean $\theta_P$. Assume the operation costs $D_{\text{operation}}$ dollars and each post-operative year medical costs for immunosuppressants and other prescriptions amount to $D_\text{annual}$ dollars. 

For the literature questions below, use the [Milliman Research Report on 2020 U.S. organ and tissue transplants](https://www.milliman.com/-/media/milliman/pdfs/articles/2020-us-organ-tissue-transplants.ashx) if possible. Parts (g) and (h) relate to the [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_cost-effectiveness_ratio). Only part (g) requires Monte Carlo simulation. 

(a) Identify a reasonable value of $\theta_N$ from the literature.

(b) Calculated the monthly mortality based on the value of $\theta_N$ determined in (a).

(c) Identify a reasonable value of $\theta_T$ from the literature.

(d) Identify a reasonable value of $\theta_P$ from the literature.

(e) Identify a reasonable value of $D_{\text{operation}}$ from the literature.

(f) Identify a reasonable value of $D_{\text{annual}}$ from the literature.

(g) Based on the values found above, estimate the expected additional cost per year of life gained by having a transplant? 

(h) Calculate the ratio of the expected additional cost to the expected additional benefit.
