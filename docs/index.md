# Fundamentals of Probability

## Coins, Urns, and Bags

:::{.example #flips .lizi}
Consider 100 flips of a fair coin.

(a) What is the probability of observing exactly 50 heads in 100 flips of a fair coin?

(b) What is the probability of observing 50 or more heads?

(c) How many heads would be extreme in the sense that there is less than a 5% chance of observing that many heads or more?

:::{.exercise #marbles name="marbles" .prob}
Suppose thereâ€™s a bag containing 50 marbles with each marble being either red or yellow. 

(a) Five marbles are randomly selected **with replacement** and each one is found to be yellow. What is the probability all of the marbles in the bag are yellow?

(b) Five marbles are randomly selected **without replacement** and all are found to be yellow. What is the probability all of the marbles in the bag are yellow?

## Monte Carlo

:::{.example #gemstones name="gemstones" .lizi}
Suppose there are $n$ bags labeled $1,\ldots,n$ with bag $i$ containing $i$ rubies and $n-i$ diamonds. Suppose a bag $i$ is selected with probability directly proportional with $i$, and a random gemstone is selected from that bag. What is the probability that it is a diamond? Provide a theoretical calculation and a simulated approximation.
