# Fundamentals of Probability

## Binomial Distribution (二项分布)

:::{.example .lizi}
What is the probability of observing exactly 50 heads in 100 flips of a fair coin?
:::

```{r}
# 概率质量函数
dbinom(50,100,prob=1/2)
```

:::{.example .lizi}
What is the probability of observing 50 or more heads in 100 flips of a fair coin?
:::

```{r}
# 累积分布函数
sum(dbinom(50:100,100,prob=1/2))
1-pbinom(49,100,prob=1/2)
pbinom(49,100,prob=1/2,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

:::{.example .lizi}
How many heads out of 100 flips of a fair coin would be extreme in the sense that there is less than a 5% chance of observing that many heads or more?
:::

```{r}
# 分位函数
qbinom(.95,100,prob=1/2)
1-pbinom(57,100,prob=1/2)
1-pbinom(58,100,prob=1/2)
qbinom(.05,100,prob=1/2,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

:::{.example .lizi}
Suppose there’s a bag containing four marbles (弹珠) of which $n$ are blue and $4-n$ are white. What is the probability of drawing blue-white-blue if the marbles are replaced each time? 
:::

```{r}
n=0:4 #blue
prob=dbinom(2,3,n/4)
prob
prob/sum(prob)
```


:::{.exercise .prob}
Suppose five dice are rolled (掷五个骰子). What is the probability three or more sixes are rolled? 
:::



:::{.exercise .prob}
Suppose there’s a bag containing 50 marbles with each marble being either red or yellow. Five marbles are randomly selected **with replacement** and each one is found to be yellow. What is the probability all of the marbles in the bag are yellow?
